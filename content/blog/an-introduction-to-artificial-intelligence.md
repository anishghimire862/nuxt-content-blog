**Artificial intelligence (AI)** refers to computer systems or machines designed to simulate human-like intelligence, enabling them to perform tasks such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, adaptation, perception, and decision-making.

AI systems use algorithms, data, and machine learning (a process of iterative improvement) to autonomously adapt, improve, and execute tasks. AI autonomy means an AI can operate, make decisions, and complete tasks with varying levels of human supervision .

## Narrow AI vs. General AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)

**Narrow AI (or weak AI)** is a type of artificial intelligence specialized in performing a limited set of tasks . Examples include:

- Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa.
- Recommendation systems (e.g., YouTube, Netflix).
- Teslaâ€™s driver-assist system (Autopilot).

These systems excel at specific tasks but lack general intelligence.

### General AI (AGI or Strong AI)

**Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**, also called **Strong AI**, is a theoretical form of AI that would possess human-level intelligence. It could:

- Reason, solve problems, and perform any intellectual task a human can do .
- Learn new skills dynamically, similar to human adaptability.

AGI remains hypothetical, and no real-world examples exist today . Current AI systems are all Narrow AI.
